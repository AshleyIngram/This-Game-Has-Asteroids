This Game Has Asteroids
=======================

Introduction
------------

A small python game made for educational purposes as part of the first year Core Programming module at the [http://leeds.ac.uk](University of Leeds).

Instructions
------------

Running the game is as simple as executing the 'main.py' file in a standard Python environment.

Dependencies
------------

The game is programmed in [http://python.org](Python2) (tested on V2.7.1+) and requires the [http://pygame.org](Pygame) library (which can be downloaded [http://pygame.org/download.shtml](here)). 

Controls
---------

The game is very similar to Coptor (or any number of other clones along the same lines). The idea is to navigate the spacecraft as far as possible, avoiding asteroids and collecting floating money bags. 

* Space - Engages thrusters making the craft go up. Releasing the key will make the spaceship gradually fall.
* Enter/Up/Down - Used to navigate menus
